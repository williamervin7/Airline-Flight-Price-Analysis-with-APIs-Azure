        "# 🛫 Flight Price Forecasting Pipeline\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🎯 Project Goal\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this notebook is to develop a **robust machine learning model** capable of predicting flight prices for specific routes. By accurately forecasting the expected price of a flight, we can detect **\"deals\"** (offers priced significantly below the predicted market rate) and **\"overpriced\"** listings, providing actionable advice to users on whether to **Buy Now** or **Wait**.\n",

        "## 📊 Data Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The raw data consists of multiple daily scrapes from the of flight itinerary information. Crucially, the raw data is at the **flight segment level**, meaning multi-connection journeys appear as multiple rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Source:** Aggregated daily flight offers from Amademus API.\n",
        "* **Key Challenge:** The price landscape is highly **volatile**. Prices change frequently due to dynamic pricing algorithms, load factors, and time-to-departure. Our feature engineering must account for this volatility.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## 🛠️ Methodology Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The pipeline uses a multi-stage approach, leveraging advanced **time-series feature engineering** and **Gradient Boosting** models (LightGBM) to capture the complex patterns in flight price behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Data Cleaning (Segment Consolidation)\n",
        "\n",
        "The raw, segment-level data is aggregated into a single, clean record per unique flight **journey** (`OfferID`). This forms the base dataset for all subsequent steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Time-Series Feature Engineering\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the most critical stage. We create **lagged price features** and **rolling statistics** (mean, standard deviation) by tracking the history of the *minimum price* for a specific flight date. This converts noisy daily price observations into stable, predictive time-series signals.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Model Training & Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "A LightGBM Regressor is trained using **Time Series Cross-Validation (TSCV)**. TSCV ensures that the model is only ever trained on historical data, validating its performance on future data in a manner that realistically simulates deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Deal Detection\n",
        "\n",
        "The final model predictions are used to calculate the **percentage error** between the actual price and the predicted price. Thresholds are applied to categorize offers and generate concrete recommendations:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Prediction Error % | Recommendation | Category |\n",
        "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
        "| **$\\leq -12\\%$** | 🔥 BUY NOW | **EXCELLENT** |\n",
        "| **$-12\\%$ to $-7\\%$** | ✅ STRONG BUY | **GOOD** |\n",
        "| **$> 10\\%$** | ❌ WAIT | **OVERPRICED** |\n",

        "\n",
        "We have successfully constructed and validated a complete **Flight Price Forecasting Pipeline**. This project moved from messy, segment-level raw data through rigorous feature engineering and robust modeling, resulting in an actionable deal detection system.\n",
        "\n",
        "The core achievement of this pipeline is the model's ability to accurately predict the fair market price of a flight, quantified by its low **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)** achieved via **Time Series Cross-Validation (TSCV)**. This level of accuracy allows the system to generate reliable, high-value recommendations: **\"🔥 BUY NOW\"** or **\"❌ WAIT\"**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next Phase: Deployment to Azure 🚀\n",
        "\n",
        "The next, and most critical, phase is to move this intelligence from the local notebook environment to a scalable, production-ready system. We will leverage **Microsoft Azure** to deploy the forecasting model and automate the deal detection process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The deployment will focus on two key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Azure Machine Learning Service:** To run the **data preparation and feature engineering steps** (Steps 1-4) on new, incoming data daily.\n",
        "2.  **Azure App Service / Azure Functions:** To host the saved model (`flight_price_model_v3.pkl`) and expose an **API endpoint**. This endpoint will take new flight offers as input and return the `predicted_price`, `prediction_error`, and the final `recommendation` in real-time or near-real-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "By deploying on Azure, we transform this analysis into a continuously running service that can handle massive volumes of flight data and deliver timely insights to users.\n"
